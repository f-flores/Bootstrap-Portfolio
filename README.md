# Bootstrap-Portfolio

#### Fabian Flores

## Description
I used the Bootstrap 4 CSS Framework to enhance last week's portfolio, as the assignment states. This project mainly leverages the "card" layout for the website design. The `style.css` file contains mostly "brand-specific" attributes, such as colors as well as header and footer spacing.

Bootstrap 4 provides so much functionality. Among the many helpful features, besides the "card" layout, is the 
built in spacing feature. For spacing between cards, I utilized the mb-* feature for margin bottom and offset-* for horizontal positioning.

To increase coding efficiency, I incorporated sass into the stylesheet workflow.
